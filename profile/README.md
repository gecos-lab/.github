## A laboratory for COding in GEological Sciences at the University of Milano - Bicocca.

### gecos-lab is the place where a team of (mainly) structural geologists, (mainly) from the University of Milano - Bicocca, develop coding projects for different applications in the geological sciences.
---
### Principal projects developed at gecos-lab are:
\
[DomStudioFracStat1D](https://github.com/gecos-lab/DomStudioFracStat1D): a Matlab App used for statistical analysis of 1D scanline data as in [Bistacchi A., Mittempergher S., Martinelli M., Storti F., 2020. On a new robust workflow for the statistical and spatial analysis of fracture data collected with scanlines (or the importance of stationarity), Solid Earth, 11, 2535â€“2547](https://doi.org/10.5194/se-11-2535-2020). The algorithms behind [DomStudioFracStat1D](https://github.com/gecos-lab/DomStudioFracStat1D) have also been refactored in [Streamline2Scanline](https://github.com/gecos-lab/Streamline2Scanline), used for the analysis of spacing between lineaments on Mars in [De Toffoli, B., Massironi, M., Mazzarini, F., & Bistacchi, A., 2021. Rheological and mechanical layering of the crust underneath thumbprint terrains in Arcadia Planitia, Mars. Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets, 126, e2021JE007007](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021JE007007).
\
\
\
[DomStudioOrientation](https://github.com/andrea-bistacchi/DomStudioOrientation): interactive script used for the analysis of orientation data imported as CSV files with Dip / Dip Azimuth, performs K-medoids clustering and calculates von Mises-Fisher statistics.
\
\
\
[DomStudioFacets](https://github.com/gecos-lab/DomStudioFacets): a Matlab script used for the analysis of 3D facets obtained with the [CloudCompare](https://www.danielgm.net/cc/) plugin [Facets](https://www.cloudcompare.org/doc/wiki/index.php/Facets_(plugin)). [DomStudioLineaments](https://github.com/gecos-lab/DomStudioLineaments) was derived form "Facets" and performs exactly the same analysis on 2D lineaments form a GIS.
\
\
\
[SlipTendency](https://github.com/gecos-lab/SlipTendency): a Matlab stress modelling script allowing to test the proness of planes with variable attitude to slip (slip tendency, also anisotropic) or dilate (dilation tendency) under an input stress field.
\
\
\
[TensorAverage](https://github.com/gecos-lab/TensorAverage): a Matlab script to calculate average and confidence intervals of several stress tensors in reduced form.
\
\
\
[PyCalcolAr](https://github.com/gecos-lab/PyCalcolAr): Ar/Ar geochronology data processing and plotting in Python.
